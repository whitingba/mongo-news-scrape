# mongo-scrape-news


### Background
Homework 14: All the News That's Fit to Scrape. Assignment was to find a website and scrape the HTML to pull in article titles, associated link and any other information we would want to scrape. I chose Science Daily and specifically articles in the computer programming category. 
Once the website is scraped the information needs to be displayed and have the ability to save articles and a button to clear all the articles. Once saved you can save and edit notes to the articles.
